Have fun trying to survive while the demon can hear you and you can hear it

## The *Intruder*
***The Intruder*** is the one and only entity trying to enter the building *kidnapping* a single person, althought its quite difficult.

### **Entering The Building:**
***The Intruder*** can enter the building via a window and a long enter animation. Although it takes quite a while to enter the building, once ***The Intruder*** enters the building, he has a few seconds to bite anyone and execute them on contact. ***The Intruder*** has *3 bites* until he is de-summoned from the building.

## The Survivors / The Victims
During the night, the *survivors* try to survive by:

- Keeping The Power On
- Keeping ***The Intruder*** Out
- Surviving The Night

### **Windows:**
During The Night, ***The Intruder*** would try and *enter* the building via the **windows** but you have a way to stop him before they enter. As long as you close the window with the all new **Window Shutters™** by *Smart Home Inc.*
Closing the windows is as easy as pressing the switch to toggle the window shutters. Be carefull as the **Window Shutters™** deplete power and could cause your breakers to pop off.

### **Breaker & Generator**
Inside the **basement** is what powers your smart home. Although there is a screen to show you the ***power %*** and the ***stress***, its only a visual indicator. The **generator** and the **breaker** are both in the basement of your home.

### **Doors**
There are many doors all can be opened by pressing the door button near the door. Inside your new smart home, all doors are powered by ***Wireless Powering Technology*** or **WPT** created by *Smart Home Inc.*
